C++ Reference CI/CD Pipeline

We believe that code quality and fast software develop can go hand-in-hand when facilitated by a strong CI/CD pipeline without the need of a complex quality management system (QMS).

## Folder Structure
The folder structure is based on [P1204R0 - Canonical Project Structure](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1204r0.html) with the exception that for C++ modules the extension .cppm is used as per [Clang's file name requirements](https://releases.llvm.org/20.1.0/tools/clang/docs/StandardCPlusPlusModules.html#file-name-requirements).
